# Capital FM Search
This page is reponsible for displaying search results on the Capital FM Kenya website.

http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/search/

It is a really rudimentary type of website with the most basic functionality. 
It is supposed to act a a working placeholder as I build a more functional version.

Currently uses Google's Custom Search

We'll decide in the coming months whether to improve on this or come up with a completely different website.

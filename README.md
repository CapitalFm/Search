# Capital FM Search
This page is reponsible for displaying search results on the Capital FM Kenya website.

It is a really rudimentary type of website with the most basic functionality. 
It is supposed to act a a working placeholder as I build a more functional version.

Currently uses Google's Custom Search

We'll decide in the coming months whether to improve on this or come up with an overhauled codebase. Probaly the latter. Nothing much to see or learn from here apart from usage of Node and grunt tools to come up with a project
